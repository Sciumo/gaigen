This is the first release with support for C# and Java.

Some stuff still needs to be added for those languages.
Most importantly, currently you can write (for example)
c3ga.gp(x, y)
but not
x.gp(y) which some might prefer.
And for C#, there are no operator bindings yet.

Other fixes included
-fixed various test scripts for Linux and OSX.
-added doxygen test scripts.
-fixed bugs in various functions.
-reduced code size of outermorphism initialization.

The target of next release will be to add the missing C#
and Java features.
