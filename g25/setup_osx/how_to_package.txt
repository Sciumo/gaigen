Log in as root (only possible when root account is enabled).

Run 'sudo ./package_script' to copy the directory tree to /tmp and start packagemanager to package.

Copy the .pkg file to where you need it to be.

----

Note:
Logging in as root seems to be the only way to get packagemaker
to get the ownership right.
