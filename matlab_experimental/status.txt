Was using GAmatlab as an example of how to bind g25 C to matlab.
The first function (constant e1) is almost working.

GAmatlab is in ga/GAmatlab repository.

Need to create a class 'MV' with a 'constructor' MV or else
e1 cannot work.

Make sure LD_LIBRARY PATH is set OK.

Once e1 works, add a function to convert to string.
Then add e2, add addition function.

Then figure out how to do the specialized classes.

Then add a function over specialized classes.

Merge the 'g' and 't' fields.
