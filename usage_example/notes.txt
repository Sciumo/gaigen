C++: step 3
-have to make multiple loops to extract all intermediate types and functions.
-because no dualLine type, pointPair is returned from dual(L) << P


C: general:
Once 'return argument' is returned from C function, C code will be somewhat easier to write.

C: step 1:
The function cgaPoint() always returns a normalizedPoint. Need to explicitly
convert to mv type.
